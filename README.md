# Portfolio

I‚Äôm currently a Software Engineer at TikTok Effect Core SDK, where I primarily focus on performance and optimization of GPU and CPU workloads.
 
I recently earned my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (May 2025), with a strong focus in Computer Graphics. I‚Äôm deeply passionate about building high-performance physically based rendering systems.

My hands-on experience spans DirectX 12, DirectX 11, and OpenGL, along with graphics debugging tools such as RenderDoc and PIX, through which I‚Äôve built multiple rendering and engine projects. I also have a strong foundation in Software Engineering, Game Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Structures & Algorithms.

Beyond the world of Computer Science, I also find inspiration in music and art.
