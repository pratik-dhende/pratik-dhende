## Introduction
👋 Hello, I'm Pratik Dilip Dhende, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. As a Computer Science enthusiast, I'm deeply passionate about Game Programming, Software Engineering, Deep Learning, Data Structures, and Algorithms. Fueled by a commitment to learning and project creation, I've successfully undertaken various initiatives within these domains.

🎓 Throughout my academic journey, I merged my enthusiasm for fitness with deep learning, resulting in an AI-powered workout assistant and fitness guide. This project earned recognition with a published [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/document) at IEEE. My exploration of diverse computer science domains includes Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Graphics, Game Development, Game Programming, and Web Development, demonstrated through hands-on projects, certifications, and coursework.

🚀 In my professional experience, I've served as a Software Engineer, exploring iOS Development, Unity plugins, React Native apps, and Jenkins CI/CD scripts. Additionally, my role as a Game Developer involved introducing new game mechanics and features to enhance the company's gaming experience.

🏆 I've showcased my coding prowess by securing the second position in a district-level competitive coding competition. Moreover, I earned a special mention award at a hackathon and have also actively participated in game jams.

🤝 I'm always eager to connect with fellow professionals, share insights, and explore potential collaborations. Let's connect, discuss innovative ideas, and explore new opportunities together!

## Current projects I am working on:
- Optimizing [Deferred Renderer](https://github.com/pratik-dhende/Prime-Engine-Deferred-Renderer) created as a part of CSCI 522, Milestone 1.
- Implementing Volumentric Cloud Rendering using Ray Marching for the proprietary Prime Engine as a part of CSCI 522, Milestone 2.
- Adding features to [Isekai](https://github.com/pratik-dhende/Isekai).
- Implementing Ray tracer using [BRDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function) based [Physically based rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) as a part of CSCI 420 course.
